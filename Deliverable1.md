   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

**Git Master**: Trent Engelman

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Understanding the main features of Memoranda, fixing obvious bugs, and modifying
simple features of the program for our new purpose

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> As a team we acknowledged that these user stories are essential to our future progress with the project. We are highly motivated to get them done. 

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we have a fantastic understanding of what needs to get done. 



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/1leKF1rVgPY

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**
> We developed a strong understanding of the existing codebase and laid out a clear vision for what modifications we wanted to make in the future. 
> We also fixed a lot of minor flaws in the existing system and incorporated some minor touches of our own into the UI.
> We also learned about the Taiga.io API and have a better understanding of how to incorporate it into our system.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**
> The team obviously fell short of completing all of the user stories present in the Sprint backlog but still feels as if
> they contributed the hours suggested by the Kickoff document. 

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> No, probably not because many user stories remain unfinished to the level the acceptance criteria asked.

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> No, many tasks and user stories remain incomplete.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We didn't properly prioritize user stories and tasks, we underestimated the amount of time certain tasks would take, and probably didn't work consistently enough over the course of the week to settle into a good workflow.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> We had a slow start but found our footing on day 4 of the sprint and started making real progress. We also think we needed our tasks to be of a smaller size so that they could be processed & complete sooner

**Did you deliver business value?**
> Yes. Our working software didn't change significantly but the major breakthroughs were in documentation and developing a clear understanding of
> the work that needs to be done in future sprints.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We think we can better prioritize certain stories so that individual members aren't waiting for other work to finish. We also think we can have
> shorter tasks so people don't spend 10+ hours without being able to adjust the scrumboard

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We feel pretty good and much better equipped to tackle future sprints.
