# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Topic 3: Analyzing a Taiga Scrum Board  

**Sprint Number:** 2

**Scrum Master**: Jessica Kuksuk

**Git Master**: Jemimah Thomas

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** successful full functionality of the software and communication between memoranda and Taiga.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** 13

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 10

> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> They were related to all of the functionaity mentioned in Topic 3 for analyzing the Taiga Scrum Board. There were a few US that were not finished from Sprint 1 and were also moved to this sprint to finish.

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> They are all crucial and important pieces into getting the backend to work properly and function. This is also crucial because in Sprint 3 we will work on the front end UI which means that the backend will have to work properly.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes we have a good understanding of our goals and what needs to be completed. We also set up a priority list for this sprint so we know which US have higher priority compared to others, which helps us understand what needs to get done first. 



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)


| Date  | Attendees  |Rundown   | Burndown Info | TravisCI info | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
|  4/10 |  6 |  Begining of sprint updates, starting to understand tasks and functionality | Optional Pending Points: 21, Real Points: 19 | NONE  | Went Well |
| 4/13  |  6 |  A lot of big tasks got completed for functions in the backend  | Optional Pending Points: 14, Real Points: 13  | NONE  |  Went Well |
| 4/15  |  6 |  More work and team updates focused on the backend and small changes to UI and logo's. |  Optional Pending Points: 9, Real Points: 7 | NONE | Went Well |
| 4/17  |  6 | Completion of most all of the back end, with some focus on an early version of the scrumboard and login screen   |   Optional Pending Points: 7, Real Points: 5 |  NONE | Went Well  |
|   |   |   |   |  |  |
|   |   |   |   |  |  |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings they attended:


   Kevin : Num Meetings 3

   Trent : Num Meetings 3
   
   Maija : Num Meetings 3
   
   Jemi : Num Meetings 3
   
   Michael : Num Meetings 3
   
   Jessica : Num Meeting 3 


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/aQ3VeMPQ3Hc 

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> Backend is basically done! Functionality is there and all that is left is displaying that information.
> Basic foundation for UI is laid and we have a good idea of what we need to develop in the next Sprint.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We think we could have worked more consistently and we can agree that some put more hours in others.
> We did struggle to do reviews and as a result never really got everything to a 'common' branch and that was a problem throughout the sprint as we all tried to work using pieces of others' code. Process was not great and we can do better. 

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We met our Sprint goal, for the most part, but didn't get the chance to verify / integrate that functionality into the existing system. 

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, we did. 

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We had dependency issues and may have overcommitted and/or not worked consistently enough over the course of the sprint to process everything.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> This was a little different for everyone. We kind of dropped off in productivity as a team towards the end of the Sprint, as seen in our burndown.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Not many front end developments have been made so there's not a whole lot of user facing functionality to speak of at this point in time. That being said, the core components are in place to deliver this in our next Sprint.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We are working on a system that will help us communicate more frequently and asynchronously and hope to adhere to that in our next Sprint. 
> We can be faster with reviews and test more.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We are all looking forward to see the fruits of our labor realized through UI development. We're hoping the changes we make to our process will help resolve any outstanding concerns we have with the team dynamic and workflow.
