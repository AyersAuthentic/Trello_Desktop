# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Topic 3: Analyzing a Taiga Scrum Board  

**Sprint Number:** 3

**Scrum Master**: Kevin Ayers

**Git Master**: Maija Kingston

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** 

> Review and test existing backend code
> Integrate front-end & backend
> Project cleanup & refactoring as a second priority.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  

> 0 (But we have 13 in our backlog prior to Sprint Planning 3)

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 

> 7

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> These US were very important to the creation of the front-end and design, connecting the front-end to the backend, adding data, and any styling needed to create a completed version of our software to present to our customer.

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> We will get these stories done because they are the basis to a completed program. Without connecting the front-end to the backend and creating UI designs to display the information, our software would not be able to correctly display the functions and backend we created in Sprint 2.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we have a great understanding of our priorities and what needs to get done!

## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

| Date  | Attendees  | Minutes | Burndown Info | TravisCI info | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
| 4/24  |   Full Team|  10  | None  | Build Successful | None |
|  4/27 | Full Team  |  10 |  None | Build Successful | None |
|  4/29 |  Full Team |  10 | None  | Build Successful | None |
| 5/1 | Full Team | 10 | None | Build Successful | None |
| 5/2 | Full Team | 10 | None | Build Successful | None |


### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings they attended:

   Trent : 5

   Maija : 5
   
   Jemimah : 5
   
   Michael Schnapp : 5
   
   Jessica Kuksuk : 5
   
   Kevin Ayers : 5


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> The team connected the front end UI to the backend datastore that is populated by the taiga api. 

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Yes we worked very hard this sprint. 

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We mostly met the cutomers expectations. Had some trouble finishing everything but were able to deliver good business value. 

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> The team was able was able to meet the sprint goal. We had a secondary goal of refactoring that was not fully completed. This is acceptable because it was listed as secondary. 

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> The team was unable to complete all user stories on the sprint backlog. We were unable to complete US#138

**If not, what went wrong?**

> The team was assigned a large design pattern assignment in the middle of the sprint. This caused the tean to fall behind in the middle of the sprint. 

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> Unfortunately we were unable to work at a consistent rate of speed. Multiple other obligations throughout the sprint forced the team to work only on days when time was available. 

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes the team was able to deliver business value. We were successfully able to meet our sprint goal connecting the front end UI to the backend providing business value. 

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> If there were more sprints in the future the team would put and increased focus on sprint planning.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We wish we could have done more but the team is proud of the business value that was provided.
